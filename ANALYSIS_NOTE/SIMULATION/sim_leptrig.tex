\subsection{Simulating the Lepton Trigger}\label{sec:analysis.accept.trigger}
During the collection process, for an event to be written by the \abbr{DAQ} it must have passed at least one of the trigger ``bits" defined in Sec.~\ref{sec.data.trig.lepton}. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec.data.trig.lepton}, the process of lepton triggering required a coincidence between the \abbr{EC} and the \abbr{CC} subsystems. This coincidence was established by using the voltage sum of the \abbr{CC} for a sector and the voltage sum of the \abbr{EC} for the same sector and comparing each sum to a preset threshold described in Table~\ref{tab:data.ecccthresh}. However when \abbr{GSIM} simulates tracks through the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC}, it does not account for the minimum voltage threshold that was required for data collection, moreover the simulation of the trigger must match the trigger efficiency discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.trigger.verify}.

Simulation of the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} trigger ``bit 6'', Sec.~\ref{sec.data.trig.lepton}, was performed by writing an algorithm that attempted to mimic the method in which triggered data was recorded. To accomplish this a modified function, written by Simeon McAleer from FSU, was written into the simulation reconstruction algorithm. The routine returned the sector and a boolean of 0 or 1 (pass or fail), that simulated the trigger based on the following criteria;
\begin{enumerate}\label{trig:sim.all}
	\item The sector with the highest EC summed energy over threshold. \label{trig:sim.ECtot} 
	\item The sector with the highest EC Inner Layer summed energy over threshold. \label{trig:sim.ECinner} 
	\item The sector with the highest CC summed energy over threshold. \label{trig:sim.CCtot} 
	\item All three above conditions must be in same sector.
\end{enumerate}
Thresholds as described in Table~\ref{tab:data.ecccthresh} are 80~mV, 60~mV and 20~mV for \abbr{EC} \emph{inner}, \abbr{EC}\emph{total} and CC respectively. The \abbr{CC} trigger threshold was applied to groups of eight \abbr{CC} \abbr{PMT}s, called ``sim bits''. The ``sim bits'' were staggered by four \abbr{PMT}s so that each \abbr{PMT} goes into two ``sim bits'', after which all ``sim bits'' were ``\emph{OR}'''d together. If any ``sim bit'' calculated as above threshold, that specific sector was then compared to the remaining sectors to establish the condition listed in~\ref{trig:sim.CCtot}.

The \abbr{EC} \emph{inner} and \abbr{EC} \emph{total} trigger thresholds were applied to all \abbr{EC} strips in a sector. This was done by summing over the energy for every strip in every orientation of the \abbr{EC} per sector. If the energy summation for the \abbr{EC} \emph{inner} was above threshold,   that specific sector was then compared to the remaining sectors to establish the condition listed in~\ref{trig:sim.ECinner}. If the energy summation for the \abbr{EC} \emph{total} was above threshold, that specific sector was then compared to the remaining sectors to establish the condition of the sector with the highest EC summed energy over threshold.
\subsubsection{Validity of Trigger Simulation}
The actual triggered data could have been triggered by the following sceneries;
\begin{enumerate}\label{trig:get.all}
	\item $e^-$ \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} hit above preset thresholds,
	\item $e^+$ \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} hit above preset thresholds,
	\item $e^-$ \abbr{CC} hit above preset thresholds and $e^+$ \abbr{EC} hit above preset thresholds in the same sector, 
	\item $e^-$ \abbr{EC} hit above preset thresholds and $e^+$ \abbr{CC} hit above preset thresholds in the same sector. 
\end{enumerate}
The lepton trigger ``bit 6" was 100\% efficient (see Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.trigger.verify}) when the data was cut using all the conditions listed above (1, 2, 3, 4) using an ``OR" flag. This means that a $\gamma p \to p e^+ e^-$ event must satisfy at least one of the listed conditions. The reduction in events when at least one of the conditions was satisfied was 69.91\%. Prior to simulating the trigger, cutting the \abbr{MC} with the listed conditions reduced the event yield by 81.91\%. Simulating the trigger and cutting on the \abbr{MC} events with the listed conditions reduced that event yield to 69.48\%. This indicates that the trigger simulation is properly mimicking the trigger configuration used when data is collected.

%When all the conditions listed above are compared together using an ``\emph{OR}'' flag, on \pizT data, 69.91\% of events remain. To check the validity of the trigger simulation, events from the \pizT reconstructed simulation were placed under the conditions as the actual data. Without placing the boolean of 1 on the simulation, 81.91\% of events remain. Placing the boolean of 1 on the simulation, 69.48\% of events remain, indicating the trigger simulation is mimicking the actual physics events recorded by \abbr{CLAS}. 
\subsection{Simulation Kinematic Variables Verification}\label{sec:analysis.simsmear.verify}

In the Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.accept.verify} the simulation was verified for efficiency. Another systematic check on the simulation was performed to investigate the validity of the kinematic variables outputted from the simulation package, Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.simulation}. This procedure was also performed as a means to double check the conclusion about the simulation efficiency found in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.accept.verify} and to verify whether \abbr{GSIM} simulates \emph{pair-production} properly. To perform this check, first the total number of expected \pizT events as well as $\pi^+\pi^-$ events were calculated for the beam energy range 1.1~GeV-2.8~GeV using the total cross-section, $\sigma$, for \pizT and $\pi^+\pi^-$ production found in~\cite{durham} and using
\begin{align}
N_{events} = \sigma \rho L \ ,
\end{align}
where $\rho$ and $L$ are the target density and photon flux respectively. The total number of \pizT and $\pi^+\pi^-$ events can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:simsmear.Ntot}, where the left axis depicts the number of \pizT events and the right axis depicts the number of $\pi^+\pi^-$ events.
\begin{figure}[h!]\begin{center}

	\end{center}\end{figure} 
	
	Once the total number of \pizT events was determined, it was necessary to determine the number of \pizT$\to \gamma \gamma$ and \pizT $\to e^+e^- \gamma$ events to generate. This was done via the branching ratios of \pizT decay. The \pizT $\to \gamma \gamma$ has a branching ratio of ($98.823 \pm 0.034$)\% while \pizT$\to e^+e^- \gamma$ has a branching ratio of ($1.174 \pm 0.035$)\% ~\cite{pdg2014} which lead to $7.03914 \cdot10^8$ \pizT $\to \gamma \gamma$ events generated and $8.36237 \cdot10^6$ \pizT$\to e^+e^- \gamma$ events generated. Moreover, once the total number of events were determined, the generation of the events was weighted using the \pizT differential cross-section found in the SAID~\cite{SAID} database and the $\pi^+\pi^-$ differential cross-section found in the Durham~\cite{durham} database. After the events were generated, they were processed using the simulation package described in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.simulation} in which afterward were given the same fiducial cuts described in ~\cite{g12note}, kinematic constraint cuts Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.fitting.compare} and trigger simulation cuts Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.accept.trigger}. 
	
	In Figs.~\ref{fig:simsmear.beam},~\ref{fig:simsmear.prot},~\ref{fig:simsmear.Ep},~\ref{fig:simsmear.Em} it is shown that the simulation procedure appears to give an accurate representation of physics events for the incident beam, detected proton positron and electron within \abbr{CLAS}. Furthermore, the overall acceptance and simulation of \emph{pair-production} is within a normalization factor of 1.011, meaning that the number of generated events was correct within 1.1\% or the simulation has an acceptance inefficiency of 1.1\%. The different sources contributing to the final detected \epemT topology can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:simsmear.EpEm}.

\subsection{Lepton Trigger Efficiency for \pizT Candidates}\label{sec:analysis.trigger.verify}
Using all \pizT candidates for incident beam energies less than 3.6~GeV \textcolor{blue}{in which satisfy the hit quantities of the\abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} requirements outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec.data.trig.lepton} }, a trigger analysis was performed to investigate the lepton trigger ``bit 6'' efficiency. The normalization is the total number of 
\pizT events as seen in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:kinfit.final.plot} in Sec.~\ref{sec.final.data}.
The normalization is done by calculating the total number of entries for each trigger ``bit'' and normalizing by the total number of events. \textcolor{blue}{I.e., let us denote the total number of $\pi^0$ events with $N$. For each $\pi^0$ event, the trigger ``bit'' was looked at. The number of $\pi^0$ events with a valid “bit i” entry, $N_i$ is counted. The efficiency of the trigger ``bit$_i$'' is then calculated as: $\beta = N_i/N$. Since in the g12 trigger system there was no hierarchy in the trigger, i.e. no ``bit'' had a higher precedence, it is always possible that if ''bit$_i$``, was triggered, that it could have been accompanied by other trigger hits. By counting all the valid $\pi^0$ events for which trigger ``bit$_i$'' was set and dividing this value to all the valid $\pi^0$ events, we determine in how many cases trigger ''bit$_i$`` should have been set but was not.  Since we are going to use in this analysis only events with a valid ``bit 6'', the important efficiency on Fig~\ref{fig:Leptrigger}  is the one of that trigger bit. It can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:Leptrigger}  that for $\pi^0$ candidate events, below 3.6 GeV beam energy, the trigger “bit 6” efficiency ~~100\%.} 
%Since there was no hierarchy in the trigger configuration, a event can be triggered by multiple triggers. It can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:Leptrigger} that for \pizT candidate events, below 3.6~GeV beam energy, the trigger ``bit 6'' efficiency is $\approx$100\%.

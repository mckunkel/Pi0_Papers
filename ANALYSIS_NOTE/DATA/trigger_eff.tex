\subsection{Lepton Trigger Efficiency for \pizT Candidates}\label{sec:analysis.trigger.verify}
	Using all \pizT candidates for incident beam energies less than 3.6~GeV, a trigger analysis was performed to investigate the lepton trigger ``bit 6'' efficiency. The normalization is the total number of \pizT events as seen in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:kinfit.final.plot} in Sec.~\ref{sec.final.data}. The normalization is done by calculating the total amount of entries for each trigger ``bit" and normalizing by the total amount of events. Since there was no hierarchy in the trigger configuration, a event can be triggered on multiple triggers. It can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:Leptrigger} that for \pizT candidates, below 3.6~GeV beam energy, the trigger ``bit 6'' efficiency is $\approx$100\%.

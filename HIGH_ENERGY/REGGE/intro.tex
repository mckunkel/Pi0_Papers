\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}
In hadron physics, photoproduction of single pion is essential to understand the photon-nucleon vertex. At low energies, the photon-nucleon coupling establishes excited nucleon resonances which has been at the forefront of physics ''missing resonances'' search. At high energies single pion photoproduction can be used to test predictions of Regge theory, in which recent calculations~\cite{JPAC} have shown to describe the presented data well.

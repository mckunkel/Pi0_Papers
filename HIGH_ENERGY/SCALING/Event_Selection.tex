\section{\label{sec:evnt}Event Selection}
Pions were skimmed initially and then re-identified as leptons by changing the mass of the pion. This method is sufficient when the decaying particle's mass, i.e. $m_{\pi^0}$, is less than that of pions. If the event satisfied the requirements listed in Table~\ref{tab:skim.requirements}, then all \abbr{TOF}, \abbr{ST}, momentum and vertex information was outputted as well as \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} information for the $\pi^{\pm}$ particles to be used to identify leptons, as discussed in Sec~\ref{sec:analysis.pid}. To reduce the size of the data set, a cut was placed on the total missing mass of $\gamma p \to p \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$ to be less than 275~MeV. This cut was broad enough to not interfere with \piz selection from single \piz production i.e. $\gamma p \to p \pi^{0}$ when assigned the pion the lighter mass of a electron/positron. This broad cut also does not interfere with \piz production from light meson decay, i.e $\gamma p \to p \omega \to p \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$.

\section{\label{sec:level1}Normalization}
In the calculation of the differential cross-section, Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, accuracy of the total number of photons incident on the target will determine the accuracy of the cross-section measurement. The procedure for determining the total number of photons in CLAS has already been established in~\cite{clas.gflux}. This procedure was performed for the \g12 data set and is discussed further in~\cite{clas.g12.note}. In this analysis, only events which were in the ``good'' scalar interval were considered. A ``good'' scalar interval relates to data recorded when the photon flux was recorded in ``live-time''. ``Live-time'' is the time that the data acquisition was ready to record events in conjunction with CLAS. For this analysis the photon flux, gflux, was binned in increments of 25~MeV and can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:gflux}. The 25 MeV binning was chosen to compare past experiments differential cross-sections with this analysis.

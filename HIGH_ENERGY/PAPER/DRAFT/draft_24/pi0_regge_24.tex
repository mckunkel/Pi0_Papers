We report the first high precision measurement of the exclusive $\pi^0$ 
photoproduction cross section via Dalitz decay and $e^+e^-$ pair conversion 
mode on a hydrogen target in a wide kinematic range with the CLAS setup at 
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The measurement was 
performed in the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-X(\gamma)$ using a 
tagged photon beam spanning an energy interval from the ``resonance'' to 
the ``Regge'' regimes, i.e photon energies $E = 1.25-5.55$~GeV. The final 
state particles particles $p;e^+;e^-$ were detected while the photon was 
not detected. The $\pi^0$ is identified by analyzing the missing mass of 
proton.  This new data sample quadrupled the world bremsstrahlung database 
above E = 2~GeV. Our data appear to favor the Regge pole model and the 
constituent counting rule while disfavoring the Handbag 
model.

%\textbf{Introduction:} 

The rich $\pi + N$ resonance spectrum for center-of-mass 
(c.m.) energies up to 2.5~GeV provides insights and challenges concerning 
the workings of the strong interaction through partial wave expansions, 
exchange potentials, non-relativistic quark models and QCD. The $\pi^0$ 
and $\eta$ photoproduction have always been a complementary tool to 
investigate and constrain the various models and to lead to further 
insights. At the interface between the crowded low energy resonance 
cross section and the smooth higher energy, small angle behavior, 
traditionally described by Regge poles~\cite{Ader:1967tqj}, lies a 
region in which hadronic duality interpolates the varying cross section 
behavior. Exclusive $\pi$ photoproduction and $\pi$ nucleon elastic 
scattering show this duality in a semi-local sense through Finite Energy 
Sum Rules (FESR)~\cite{Armenian:1974xd}. The connection to QCD is more 
tenuous for on-shell photoproduction of pions at small scattering angles, 
but the quark content can become manifest through large fixed angle 
dimensional counting rules~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr} as well as being evident 
in semi-inclusive or exclusive electroproduction of pions, described 
through Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs)  and Generalized Parton 
Distributions (GPDs).

%---------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Regge Pole Model:} 

The Regge pole description of photoproduction amplitudes 
has a long and varied history. For $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ photoproduction, 
all applications rely on a set of known meson Regge poles. There are 
two allowed t-channel J$^{PC}$ quantum numbers series, the odd-signature 
1$^{--}$ and the 1$^{+-}$, corresponding to the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and 
the $b^0_1$, $h_1$ Reggeons, respectively. Regge cut amplitudes are 
incorporated into some models and are interpreted as rescattering of 
on-shell meson-nucleon amplitudes.  The phases between the different 
poles and cuts can be critical in determining the polarizations and the 
constructive or destructive interferences that can appear. Four models 
are considered here.

The oldest model developed by Goldstein and 
Owens~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn} has the exchange of leading Regge 
trajectories with appropriate t-channel quantum numbers along with 
Regge cuts generated via final state rescattering through Pomeron 
exchange. The Regge couplings to the nucleon were fixed by reference 
to electromagnetic form factors, SU(3)$_{flavor}$, and low energy 
nucleon-nucleon meson exchange potentials. At the time, the range of 
applicability was taken to be $s$ above the resonance region and $\mid 
t \mid \le 1.2 \, {\rm GeV}^2$. Here we will let the $\mid t \mid$ 
range extend to large $\mid t \mid$ in order to see the predicted cross 
section dips from the zeroes in Regge residues. While the dip near 
$t\approx -0.5$ GeV$^2$ is present in $\pi^0$ data, it is not in the 
recent beam asymmetry data on $\eta$ 
photoproduction~\cite{AlGhoul:2017nbp}. This is not explained by the 
standard form of the ``wrong signature" Regge residues. 

Subsequently, somewhat similar approaches were developed.  
Quite recently, Mathieu {\it et al.}~\cite{Mathieu:2015eia} (JPAC) 
(see also~\cite{Kashevarov:2017vyl}), used the same set of Regge poles, 
but a simplified form of only $\omega$ -Pomeron cuts. They show that 
daughter trajectories are not significant as an alternative to the 
Regge cuts. However, to explain the lack of $t\approx -0.5$ GeV$^2$ 
dip in $\eta$ photoproduction, they remove the standard wrong signature 
zero, {\it ad hoc}.  Donnachie and Kalashnikova~\cite{Donnachie:2015jaa} 
have included t-channel $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and the $b^0_1$, but not 
the $h_1$ Reggeon, all with different parameterizations from 
Ref.~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn}. They include $\omega, \rho \times {\rm 
Pomeron}$ cuts, as well as $\omega, \rho \times {\rm f}_2$ lower lying 
cuts, which help to fill in the wrong signature zeroes of the $\omega, 
\rho$ Regge pole residues. The model of Laget and 
collaborators~\cite{Laget:2005be} included u-channel baryon exchange. 
That model also connected the small and large t-channel regimes by a 
mechanism called ``saturating" the Regge trajectories at $\alpha(t) \, 
\rightarrow \, -1$ for $t < -1.5$ GeV$^2$, thereby describing the full 
angular range ($\theta = 0 - 2\pi$), while the other models are good 
for different ranges of the forward direction, i.e., from $|t| = 
-t_{min}$ at $\theta=0$ to $\theta=\pi/2$, where $t$ is the squared 
four-momentum transfer~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,Mathieu:2015eia,
Donnachie:2015jaa}. Here, we examine how Regge phenomenology works for 
the energy range of 2.8~GeV $< $ E$_\gamma$ $<$ 5.5~GeV.

%--------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Handbag Model:}
 
The introduction of the handbag mechanism, developed by 
Kroll \textit{et al.}~\cite{Huang:2000kd}, has provided complimentary 
possibilities for the interpretation of hard exclusive reactions. In 
this approach, the reaction is factorized into two parts, one quark 
from the incoming and one from the outgoing nucleon participate in the 
hard sub-process, which is calculable using pQCD. The soft part 
consists of all the other partons that are spectators and can be 
described in terms of GPDs~\cite{Ji:1996nm}.
The HERMES measurement of beam asymmetry in DVCS was the first 
to confirm the azimuthal dependence expected from the GPD interpretation~\cite{Amarian:2000vx}.
The handbag model applicability requires a hard scale, which, for meson 
photoproduction, is only provided by large transverse momentum. That 
corresponds to large angle production, roughly for 
$-0.6~\leq\cos\theta~\leq 0.6$.  Here, we examined how the handbag 
model may extend for the $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$ case as Kroll 
\textit{et al.} proposed. The distribution amplitude for the 
quark+antiquark to $\pi^0$ is fixed by other phenomenology and 
contributes to orders of magnitude short-fall.

%--------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Scaling:} 

Binary reactions in QCD, with large momentum transfer 
occur via gluon and quark exchanges between colliding particles. The 
constituent counting rules of Brodsky and Farrar~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr} 
has a simple recipe to predict the energy dependence of the 
differential cross sections of two-body reactions at large angles 
when $t/s$ is finite and is kept constant.  The lightest meson 
photoproduction was examined in terms of the counting 
rules~\cite{Anderson:1976ph,Jenkins:1995bk,Zhu:2002su,Chen:2009sda,
Kong:2015yzn}. As has been observed, first of all at SLAC by 
Anderson \textit{et al.}, the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow\pi^+n$ 
shows agreement with constituent counting rules that predict the 
cross section should vary as $s^{-7}$~\cite{Anderson:1976ph}. The 
agreement extends down to s = 6~GeV$^2$ where baryon resonances are 
still playing a role.  Here, we examined how the counting rule is 
applicable to the $\gamma p\rightarrow\pi^0p$ up to s = 10~GeV$^2$. 

Previous bremsstrahlung measurements, for $2~\leq E\leq 
18$~GeV (1964 -- 1979) gave 451 data points $d\sigma/dt(|t|)$s for 
$\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$~\cite{brem}, have very large systematic 
uncertainties and do not have sufficient accuracy to perform 
comprehensive phenomenological analyses.  A previous CLAS measurement 
has an overall systematic uncertainty of 5\% and its contribution for 
$2.0~\leq E\leq 2.9$~GeV is limited to 164 
$d\sigma/dt(|t|)$s~\cite{Dugger:2007bt}. 

The new measurement, presented here, currently is the only 
		measurement that bridges resonance and high energy, both narrow and wide 
		angles, regions of exclusive $\pi^0$ photoproduction. This significantly 
		extends the available database, facilitating the examination of the 
		resonance, ``Regge", and wide angle QCD regimes of phenomenology. The 
		broad range of c.m. energy, $\sqrt{s}$, is particularly helpful in 
		sorting out the phenomenology associated with both Regge and QCD-based 
		models of the nucleon~\cite{Kroll:2017hym}.

In this work, we provide a large set of differential 
cross section values from $E$ = 1.275 -- 5.425~MeV in laboratory photon 
energy, corresponding to a range of c.m. energies, $W$ = 1.81 -- 
3.33~GeV.  We have compared the Regge pole, the handbag, and the 
constituent counting rule phenomenology with the new CLAS experimental 
information on $d\sigma/dt(|t|)$ for the $\gamma p\rightarrow\pi^0p$ 
reaction above the ``resonance" regime. As will be seen, this data 
set quadruples the world bremsstrahlung database above E = 2~GeV and 
constrains the high energy phenomenology well with previous a CLAS 
measurement~\cite{Dugger:2007bt}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Experiment:} 

The experiment was performed during March-June, 2008
with the CLAS setup at TJNAF using a tagged photon beam produced by 
bremsstrahlung from the 5.72~GeV electron beam provided by the CEBAF 
accelerator, which impinged upon a liquid hydrogen target. 
The experiment as a whole was a set of different 
experiments running at the same time with the same experimental 
conguration (cryogenic target, tagger, trigger conguration, and CLAS) 
and was designated with the name ``g12". Particle identication for 
the experiment was based on  vs. momentum$\times$charge.
The experimental details are given in Ref.~\cite{g12}. The reaction 
of interest is the photoproduction of neutral pions on a hydrogen 
target $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$, where the neutral pions were 
detected via external conversion, $\pi^0 \rightarrow\gamma\gamma 
\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$ and subsequent Dalitz decay $\pi^0
\rightarrow\gamma^\ast\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$. Running the 
experiment at high beam current was possible due to the final state 
containing three charged tracks, $p;e^+;e^-$, as opposed to single 
prong charged track detection, which impose limitations due to trigger 
and data acquisition restrictions.

%----------------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Data analysis:} 

Lepton identification was based on conservation of the 
$\pi^0$ mass. Once the data was skimmed for p, $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, 
all particles that were $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$ were tentatively assigned 
to be electrons or positrons based on their charge (for details, 
see Ref.~\cite{Kunkel}).  After particle selection, standard $g12$ 
calibration, fiducial cuts~\cite{g12} and timing cuts were applied 
in the analysis.

\end{figure*}

The analysis employed three separate kinematic fitting 
hypotheses, 4-C, 1-C, and 2-C, as well as a cut on the missing 
energy of the detected system. The 4-C fit used the $\gamma 
p\rightarrow p\pi^+\pi^-$ channel to filter background from double 
charged pion production from single $\pi^0$ production. The 1-C fit
was used for the topology of $\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ 
to fit to a missing final state photon.  The 2-C fit was used for 
the topology of $\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ to fit to a 
missing final state photon but also to constrain the invariant 
mass of $e^+e^-(\gamma)$=m$^2_{\pi^0}$. The values of 
the ``confidence levels" cuts employed was determined using 
statistical significance to get the best signal/background ratio.
 The ``confidence levels'' for each constraint were consistent 
between $g12$ data and Monte-Carlo simulations. 
Monte-Carlo generation was performed using the PLUTO++ package 
developed for the HADES Collaboration~\cite{PLUTO}.

        placed on the $M_x^2(p)$ distribution to select \pizT events.}
        \label{fig:pi0_peak}
\end{figure}

The remainder of the background was attributed to $\pi^+\pi^-$
events. To reduce the background further, a comparison of the 
missing mass squared off the proton and the $pe^+e^-$ missing 
energy of the system was performed, see Fig.~\ref{fig:sys}. This 
comparison revealed that the majority of $\pi^+\pi^-$ background 
has missing energy less than 75~MeV. To eliminate this background 
all events with a missing energy less than 75~MeV were removed.

The distribution of the proton missing mass for events with 
$pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ in the final state is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak}. 
A fit is performed with the Crystal Ball function~\cite{Oreglia:1980cs,
Skwarnicki:1986xj} for the signal, plus a 3rd order polynomial function 
for the background. The total signal+background is shown by a red solid 
line. The fit results in $M_{\pi^0}^2$ = 0.0179~GeV$^2$ and the Gaussian 
$\sigma$=0.0049~GeV$^2$. To select \pizT events, an asymmetric cut, from 
the measured mean value, was placed in the range $0.0056 \le  M_x^2(p) 
\le 0.035$. This cut range can be seen as the red arrow in the bottom 
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak} along with the ratio of background 
events to the total number of events. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak}, 
the event selection strategy for this analysis allowed to have a 
negligible integrated background of no more than $\sim1.05\%$.

Overall the systematic uncertainty is independent of the production angle 
and varies between 9\% and 12\% as a function of energy. The individual 
contributions came from particle efficiency, sector-to-sector efficiency, 
flux determination, missing energy cut, 4-C, 2-C, and 1-C probabilities, 
target length, branching ratio, fiducial cut, and the z-vertex cut.
The largest contributions to the systematic uncertainties 
were the sector-to-sector (4.4 -- 7.1\%), flux determination (5.7\%),
and the cut on the 1-C t pull probability (1.6 -- 6.1\%). All systematic 
uncertainties and there determinations are described in Ref.~\cite{Kunkel}.

At higher energies (above $s\sim$ 6~GeV$^2$) and large c.m. angles 
($\theta\geq$ 90$^\circ$) in c.m., the results are consistent with 
the $s^{-7}$ scaling, at fixed $t/s$, as expected from the 
constituent counting rule~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr}. 
The black dash-dotted line at 90$^\circ$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:scaling}) 
is a result of the fit of new CLAS $g12$ data only, performed with a 
power function $\sim s^{-n}$, leading to n = 6.89$\pm$0.26.  
Oscillations observed at 50$^\circ$ and 70$^\circ$ up to 
s$\sim$10~GeV$^2$ indicate that the constituent 
counting rule requires higher energies and higher $|t|$ before it 
can provide a valid description.

%-----------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Comparison to Phenomenological Models:} 

In Figs.~\ref{fig:t_data} and \ref{fig:kroll}, the 
$d\sigma/dt(|t|)$ values are shown along with predictions from 
Regge pole and cut~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,Laget:2005be,
Mathieu:2015eia,Donnachie:2015jaa} models and the 
handbag~\cite{Huang:2000kd} model. 

Below $|t|\sim$0.6~GeV$^2$ there is a small difference between 
different Regge approaches.  Overall, the Regge approximation 
becomes less relevant below E = 3~GeV (Fig.~\ref{fig:t_data}).  
This CLAS data make this statement more apparent.  Note that 
some small structures start to appear around $|t| = 
0.3-0.6$~GeV$^2$~($\cos\theta = 0.6-0.8$) below E = 4~GeV.  
This is surprising since there was no previous 
indication of this dip, in data, prior to this measurement. 
Note that the Regge amplitudes imposes non negligible constraints 
for the ``resonance" region.  Our data show two more visible dips 
above E = 4~GeV and around $|t|\sim$3~GeV$^2$ and 
$|t|\sim$5~GeV$^2$, where the Regge models~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,
Laget:2005be,Donnachie:2015jaa} predict incorrect signature zeroes, 
this is where the Regge trajectories cross negative even integers. 
For the dominant vector meson Regge poles, these dips should appear 
at approximately $-t=0.6, \, 3.0, \, 5.0$~GeV$^2$,  which agrees 
with the data.  The description of the $\pi^0$ photoproduction 
cross sections at largest $|t|$ requires some improvement of the 
Regge model probably by including u-channel exchange.

Fig.~\ref{fig:kroll} shows that the new CLAS data are orders of 
magnitude higher than the handbag model for $\pi^0$ 
photoproduction below $s$ = 11~GeV$^2$ (blue double 
solid line).

%\textbf{Conclusions:} 

Through the experiments described above, an extensive and precise 
data set (2030 data points) on the differential cross section for 
$\pi^0$ photoproduction from the proton has been obtained over 
the range of $1.81~\leq W\leq 3.33$~GeV. A novel approach based 
on the use of the Dalitz decay mode was employed for extracting 
the cross sections from the experimental data. Measurements are 
performed in the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-X(\gamma)$ 
using a tagged photon beam spanning the energy interval covered 
by ``resonance" and ``Regge" regimes.

The measurements obtained here have been compared to existing 
data. The overall agreement is good, while the data provided 
here quadrupled the world bremsstrahlung database above E = 
2~GeV and covered the previous reported energies with finer 
resolution. By comparing this new and greatly expanded data set 
to the predictions of several phenomenological models, the 
present data were found to support the Regge pole model and the 
constituent counting rule while disfavoring the handbag approach.

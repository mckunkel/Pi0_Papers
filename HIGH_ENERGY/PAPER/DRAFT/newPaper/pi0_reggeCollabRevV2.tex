\vskip 0.2in
Exclusive photoproduction cross sections have been measured for the process $\gamma p \rightarrow p\pi^0(e^+e^-(\gamma))$ with the Dalitz decay final state  using tagged photon energies in the range of $E_{\gamma} = 1.275-5.425$~GeV. The complete angular distribution of the final state $\pi^0$, for the entire photon energy range up to large $t$ and $u$, has been measured for the first time.
The data obtained show that the cross section $d\sigma/dt$, at mid to large angles, decreases with energy as $s^{-6.89\pm 0.26} $. This is in agreement with the perturbative QCD quark counting rule prediction of $s^{-7} $. Paradoxically, the size of angular distribution of measured cross sections is greatly underestimated by the QCD based Generalized Parton Distribution  mechanism at highest available invariant energy $s=11$~GeV$^2$. At the same time, the Regge exchange based models for $\pi^0$ photoproduction are more consistent with experimental data.

%\textbf{Introduction:} 
In general, there are  properties of $\pi^0$ that make this particle very special for our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). To name a few: it is the lightest element of all visible hadronic matter in the Universe; according to its $q \bar q$  content the $\pi^0$ has a mass much less than one would expect from a constituent quark mass, $m \approx$~350~MeV and it has an extremely short life time, $\tau \approx 10^{-16}$~s. Its main decay mode,   $\pi^0\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, with a branching ratio~$\approx 99\%$, played a crucial role in confirming the number of colors in QCD and in establishing the chiral anomaly in gauge theories. With all this being said,  the structure and properties of $\pi^0$ are not completely understood. 

One of the cleanest ways to obtain additional experimental information about the $\pi^0$ is high energy photoproduction on a proton, as the incoming electromagnetic wave is structureless, contrary to any hadronic probe. Even after decades of experimental efforts, precise data of the elementary reaction $\gamma  p \rightarrow p\pi^0 $, above the resonance region and at large values of all Mandelstam variables $s$, $t$, and $u$, are lacking.

At the interface between the crowded low energy resonance 
production regime and the smooth higher energy, small angle behavior, 
traditionally described by Regge poles~\cite{Ader:1967tqj}, lies a 
region in which hadronic duality interpolates the different excitation function
behavior. Exclusive $\pi$ photoproduction and $\pi$ nucleon elastic 
scattering show this duality in a semi-local sense through Finite Energy 
Sum Rules (FESR)~\cite{Armenian:1974xd}. The connection to QCD is more 
tenuous for on-shell photoproduction of pions at small scattering angles, 
but the quark content can become manifest through large fixed angle 
dimensional counting rules~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr}, as well as being evident 
in semi-inclusive or exclusive electroproduction of pions, described 
through Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs)  and Generalized Parton 
Distributions (GPDs).

%---------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Regge Pole Model:} 

The Regge pole description of photoproduction amplitudes 
has a long and varied history. For $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ photoproduction, 
all applications rely on a set of known meson Regge poles. There are 
two allowed $t$-channel J$^{PC}$ quantum numbers, the odd-signature (odd spin) 
1$^{--}$ ($\rho^0$, $\omega$) and the 1$^{+-}$ ($b^0_1$, $h_1$) Reggeons. Regge cut amplitudes are 
incorporated into some models and are interpreted as rescattering of 
on-shell meson-nucleon amplitudes.  The phases between the different 
poles and cuts can be critical in determining the polarizations and the 
constructive or destructive interferences that can appear. Four distinct Regge models 
are considered here.

An early model developed by Goldstein and 
Owens~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn} has the exchange of leading Regge 
trajectories with appropriate $t$-channel quantum numbers along with 
Regge cuts generated via final state rescattering through Pomeron 
exchange. The Regge couplings to the nucleon were fixed by reference 
to electromagnetic form factors, SU(3)$_{flavor}$, and low energy 
nucleon-nucleon meson exchange potentials. At the time, the range of 
applicability was taken to be above the resonance region and $\mid 
t \mid \le 1.2 \, {\rm GeV}^2$, where $t$ is the squared 
four-momentum transfer. Here we will let the $\mid t \mid$ 
range extend to large $\mid t \mid$ in order to see the predicted cross 
section dips from the zeroes in the Regge residues. Because even signature partners ($A_2$, $f_2$) of the odd spin poles ($\rho$, $\omega$) lie on the same trajectories, the Regge residues are required to have zeroes to cancel the even (wrong) signature poles in the physical region - these extra zeroes are called nonsense wrong signature zeroes (NWSZ)~\cite{CHIU1971477}. While the dip near 
$t\approx -0.5$ GeV$^2$ is present in the $\pi^0$ cross section data, it is absent in the 
beam asymmetry, $\Sigma$, measurement for $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ 
photoproduction~\cite{AlGhoul:2017nbp}. This is not explained by the 
standard form of the NWSZ Regge residues. 
  
Quite recently, Mathieu {\it et al.}~\cite{Mathieu:2015eia} from the Joint Physics Analysis Center (JPAC)
(see also~\cite{Kashevarov:2017vyl}), used the same set of Regge poles, 
but a simplified form of only $\omega$ -Pomeron cuts. They show that 
daughter trajectories are not significant as an alternative to the 
Regge cuts. However, to reproduce the lack of $t\approx -0.5$ GeV$^2$ 
dip in $\eta$ photoproduction, they remove the standard wrong signature 
zero, i.e., the NWSZ.  Donnachie and Kalashnikova~\cite{Donnachie:2015jaa} 
have included $t$-channel $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $b^0_1$ exchange, but not 
the $h_1$ Reggeon, all with different parameterizations from 
Ref.~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn}. They include $\omega, \rho \otimes {\rm 
Pomeron}$ cuts, as well as $\omega, \rho \otimes {\rm f}_2$ lower lying 
cuts, which help to fill in the wrong signature zeroes of the $\omega, 
\rho$ Regge pole residues. The model of Laget and collaborators~\cite{Laget:2005be} included 
$u$-channel baryon exchange, which dominate at backward angles, along with 
	elastic and inelastic unitarity cuts and a mechanism called ``saturating'', to fill the intermediate 
	$t$ range. ``Saturating''  has all trajectories $\alpha(t) \rightarrow -1$ as a minimum. With 
	these ingredients, the model is expected to describe the full angular range ($\theta_{\pi}= 0 \to 180^{\circ}$), where $\theta_{\pi}$ is the pion polar production and in the c.m.~frame,
	while the other models are good for more limited ranges of $t$~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,Mathieu:2015eia, Donnachie:2015jaa}. 
Here, we examine how Regge phenomenology works for the energy range of 2.8~GeV $< $ E$_\gamma$ $<$ 5.5~GeV.

In addition to Regge pole models, the introduction of the Handbag mechanism, developed by 
Kroll \textit{et al.}~\cite{Huang:2000kd}, has provided complementary 
possibilities for the interpretation of hard exclusive reactions. In 
this approach, the reaction is factorized into two parts, one quark 
from the incoming and one from the outgoing nucleon participate in the 
hard sub-process, which is calculable using Perturbative Quantum ChromoDynamics (pQCD). The soft part 
consists of all the other partons that are spectators and can be 
described in terms of GPDs~\cite{Ji:1996nm}.
%The HERMES measurement of beam asymmetry in DVCS was the first 
%to confirm the azimuthal dependence expected from the GPD interpretation~\cite{Amarian:2000vx}.
The Handbag model applicability requires a hard scale, which, for meson 
photoproduction, is only provided by large transverse momentum, which 
corresponds to large angle production, roughly for 
$-0.6~\leq\cos \theta_{\pi}~\leq 0.6$.  Here, we examined how the Handbag 
model may extend to the $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$ case proposed in~\cite{Huang:2000kd}. The distribution amplitude for the 
quark+antiquark to $\pi^0$ is fixed by other phenomenology and 
leads to the strong suppression of the production cross section.

Binary reactions in QCD with large momentum transfer 
occur via gluon and quark exchanges between the colliding particles. The 
constituent counting rules of Brodsky and Farrar~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr} 
provide a simple recipe to predict the energy dependence of the 
differential cross sections of two-body reactions at large angles 
when $t/s$ is finite and is kept constant.  The lightest meson 
photoproduction was examined in terms of these counting 
rules~\cite{Anderson:1976ph,Jenkins:1995bk,Zhu:2002su,Chen:2009sda,
Kong:2015yzn}. As was first observed at SLAC by 
Anderson \textit{et al.}~\cite{Anderson:1976ph}, the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow n \pi^+$ 
shows agreement with constituent counting rules that predict the 
cross section should vary as $s^{-7}$. The 
agreement extends down to $s$ = 6~GeV$^2$ where baryon resonances are 
still playing a role.  Here, we examined how applicable the counting rule is 
for $\gamma p\rightarrow  p\pi^0$ up to $s$ = 11~GeV$^2$. 

Previous bremsstrahlung measurements of $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$, for $2~\leq E_{\gamma} \leq 
18$~GeV (1964 -- 1979) provided 451 data points for differential cross section $d\sigma/dt$~\cite{brem}, have very large systematic 
uncertainties and do not have sufficient accuracy to perform 
comprehensive phenomenological analyses.  A previous CLAS measurement of $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$, for $2.0~\leq E_{\gamma} \leq 2.9$~GeV, has an overall systematic uncertainty of 5\% but only provided 164 data points for differential cross section $d\sigma/dt$~\cite{Dugger:2007bt}.

The results described here are the first to allow a detailed analysis, bridging the nucleon resonance and high energy regions over a wide angular range, of exclusive pion photoproduction. By significantly extending the database they facilitate
the examination
%The new measurement, presented here, currently is the only 
%		measurement that bridges resonance and high energy, both narrow and wide 
%		angles, regions of exclusive $\pi^0$ photoproduction. This significantly 
%		extends the available database, facilitating the examination 
%		 
		of the resonance, ``Regge", and wide angle QCD regimes of phenomenology. The 
		broad range of c.m. energy, $\sqrt{s}$, is particularly helpful in 
		sorting out the phenomenology associated with both Regge and QCD-based 
		models of the nucleon~\cite{Kroll:2017hym}.

In this work, we provide a large set of differential 
cross section values from $E_{\gamma} = 1.25-5.55$~GeV in laboratory photon 
energy, corresponding to a range of c.m. energies, $W$ = 1.81 -- 
3.33~GeV.  We have compared the Regge pole, the Handbag, and the 
constituent counting rule phenomenology with the new CLAS experimental 
information on $d\sigma/dt$ for the $\gamma p\rightarrow  p\pi^0$ 
reaction above the ``resonance" regime. As will be seen, this data 
set quadruples the world bremsstrahlung database above $E_{\gamma} =$ 2~GeV and 
constrains the high energy phenomenology well with a previous CLAS 
measurement~\cite{Dugger:2007bt}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Experiment:} 

The experiment was performed during March-June, 2008
with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory~\cite{meck} using a energy-tagged photon beam produced by 
bremsstrahlung from a 5.72~GeV electron beam provided by the CEBAF 
accelerator, which impinged upon a liquid hydrogen target,
%. 
%The experiment as a whole was a set of different 
%experiments running at the same time with the same experimental 
%configuration (cryogenic target, tagger, trigger configuration, and CLAS) 
and was designated with the name $g12$. 
The experimental details are given in Ref.~\cite{g12}. The reaction 
of interest is the photoproduction of neutral pions on a hydrogen 
target $\gamma p\rightarrow p\pi^0$, 
where the neutral pions decay into an $e^+e^-\gamma$ final state either due to external conversion, $\pi^0 \rightarrow\gamma\gamma 
\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$ or via Dalitz decay $\pi^0
\rightarrow\gamma^\ast\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$. Running the 
experiment at high beam current was possible due to the final state 
containing three charged tracks, $p$, $e^+$, $e^-$, as opposed to single 
prong charged track detection which impose limitations due to trigger 
and data acquisition restrictions.

%----------------------------------------------------------
%\textbf{Data analysis:} 

Particle identification for the experiment was based on $\beta$ vs. momentum$\times$charge. 
Lepton identification was based on a kinematic constraint to the $\pi^0$ mass. 
Once the data was skimmed for $p$, $\pi^+$, and $\pi^-$ tracks, 
all particles that were $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$ were tentatively assigned 
to be electrons or positrons based on their charge (for details, 
see Ref.~\cite{Kunkel,KunkelPhD}). After particle selection, standard $g12$ 
calibration, fiducial cuts and timing cuts were applied 
in the analysis~\cite{g12}.

\end{figure*}
Different kinematic fits were employed to cleanly identify the 
$\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ reaction. They were applied 
to filter background from misidentified double pion production to 
the single $\pi^0$ production, to constrain the missing mass of entire 
final state to a missing photon and to ensure that the fit to the missing 
photon constrained the squared invariant 
mass of $e^+e^-(\gamma)$=m$^2_{\pi^0}$. The values of the confidence levels cuts employed was 
determined using the statistical significance to get the best signal/background ratio.
The confidence levels for each constraint were consistent 
between the $g12$ data and Monte-Carlo simulations. 
Monte-Carlo generation was performed using the PLUTO++ package 
developed for the HADES Collaboration~\cite{PLUTO}.

The remainder of the background was attributed to $\pi^+\pi^-$
events. To reduce the background further, a comparison of the 
missing mass squared off the proton, $\mathrm{M_x^2(p) =(P_\gamma + P_p -P^{'}_p)^2}$, in terms of the four-momenta of the incoming photon, target proton, and final state proton, respectively, and the missing energy of detected system, $\mathrm{E_X(pe^+e^-)}= E_\gamma + E_p  -  E^{'}_p - E_{e^{+}} - E_{e^{-}} $, was performed, see Fig.~\ref{fig:sys}. This 
comparison revealed that the majority of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ background 
has missing energy less than 75~MeV. To eliminate this background 
all events with a missing energy less than 75~MeV were removed.

The distribution of the proton missing mass squared for events with 
$pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ in the final state is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak}. 
A fit was performed with the Crystal Ball function~\cite{Oreglia:1980cs,
Skwarnicki:1986xj} for the signal, plus a 3rd order polynomial function 
for the background. The total signal+background fit is shown by the red solid 
line. The fit resulted in $M_{\pi^0}^2$ = 0.0179~GeV$^2$ with a Gaussian width
$\sigma$=0.0049~GeV$^2$. To select \pizT events, an asymmetric cut about the measured value was placed 
in the range $0.0056 $~GeV$^2 \le  M_x^2(p) 
\le 0.035$~GeV$^2$. This cut range can be seen as the arrow in the bottom 
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak} along with the ratio of background 
events to the total number of events. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi0_peak}, 
the event selection strategy for this analysis led to a 
negligible integrated background estimated to be no more than $1.05\%$.

The total systematic uncertainty varied between 9\% and 12\% as a function of energy. The individual contributions came from particle efficiency, sector-to-sector efficiency, 
flux determination, missing energy cut, the kinematic fitting probabilities, 
target length, branching ratio, fiducial cut, and the $z$-vertex cut.
The largest contributions to the systematic uncertainties 
were the sector-to-sector (4.4 -- 7.1\%), flux determination (5.7\%),
and the cut on the 1-C pull probability (1.6 -- 6.1\%). All systematic

As it was mentioned above there are two subprocesses that may led to the same final state $\pi^0 \rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$. Both subprocesses
were simulated in the Monte Carlo with their corresponding branching ratios and used to obtain cross sections from experimentally observed yield of neutral pions.

The new CLAS high statistics $\gamma p \to \pi^0 p$ cross sections from
this analysis are compared in Figs.~\ref{fig:scaling}
and \ref{fig:t_data} with data from previous CLAS~\cite{Dugger:2007bt},  bremsstrahlung DESY, Cambridge
Electron Accelerator (CEA), and SLAC, and Electron Synchrotron at
Cornell Univ. measurements~\cite{brem}, as
well as lower c.m. energy measurements by A2 Collaboration at MAMI~\protect\cite{Adlarson:2015byy}.

At higher energies (above $s\sim$ 6~GeV$^2$) and large c.m. angles 
($\theta_{\pi}\geq$ 90$^\circ$), the results are consistent with 
the $s^{-7}$ scaling, at fixed $t/s$, as expected from the 
constituent counting rule~\cite{Brodsky:1973kr}. 
The black dash-dotted line at 90$^\circ$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:scaling}) 
is a result of the fit of new CLAS $g12$ data only, performed with a 
power function $\sim s^{-n}$, leading to $n = 6.89\pm$0.26.  
Structures observed at 50$^\circ$ and 70$^\circ$ up to 
$s\sim$11~GeV$^2$ indicate that the constituent 
counting rule requires higher energies and higher $|t|$ before it 
can provide a complete description.
In Figs.~\ref{fig:t_data},~\ref{fig:t_dataB} and \ref{fig:kroll}, the 
$d\sigma/dt$ results are shown along with predictions from 
Regge pole and cut~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,Laget:2005be,
Mathieu:2015eia,Donnachie:2015jaa} models and the 
Handbag~\cite{Huang:2000kd} model. 

Overall, the Regge approximation 
becomes less applicable below $E_{\gamma}$ = 3~GeV (Fig.~\ref{fig:t_data}). 
Below $|t|\sim$1.0~GeV$^2$ there is a small difference between 
different Regge approaches.    
Note that some small dips start to appear around $|t| \sim 0.5$~GeV$^2$
~($\cos \theta_{\pi} = 0.6-0.8$) where the Regge models predict a dip.  
Prior to this measurement there was no indication of these dips.
Note that the Regge amplitudes impose non-negligible constraints when continued down to the 
``resonance" region.
Our data show another visible dip above $E_{\gamma}$ = 3.6~GeV at around $|t|\sim$2.6~GeV$^2$ and possible manifestation of another``possible new structure'' around $|t|\sim$5~GeV$^2$ for $E_{\gamma} >$ 4.1~GeV, where the Regge models~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn,
Laget:2005be,Donnachie:2015jaa} predict wrong signature zeroes, 
this is where the Regge trajectories cross negative even integers. 
For the dominant vector meson Regge poles, these dips should appear 
at approximately $-t=0.6, \, 3.0, \, 5.0$~GeV$^2$,  which agrees 
with the data. For a better visibility of these dips, as an example, a magnified version of Fig~\ref{fig:t_data}, for $E_\gamma$ = 4.125~GeV, is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:t_dataB}. 
The dip at about $|t|\sim$5.0~GeV$^2$ is best modeled by~\cite{Goldstein:1973xn}. 
The description of the $\pi^0$ photoproduction 
cross sections at largest $\vert t \vert$ requires improving the 
Regge model by including, for instance, additional exchange mechanisms.

%\textbf{Conclusions:} 
%------------------------------------------------------

In this experiment a novel approach was employed based on the $\pi^{0}$ Dalitz decay 
mode. Although this decay mode has a branching fraction of only about 1\%, 
the enhanced event trigger selectivity enabled the figure of merit to be 
sufficiently high in order to extend the existing world measurements into 
an essentially unmeasured {\it terra incognita} domain.
%
Through the experiments described above, an extensive and precise 
data set (2030 data points) on the differential cross section for 
$\pi^0$ photoproduction from the proton has been obtained 
for the first time, except for a few points from previous measurements, 
over the range of $1.81~\leq W\leq 3.33$~GeV. 

Measurements were 
performed in the reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ 
using a tagged photon beam spanning the energy interval covered 
by the ``resonance" and ``Regge" regimes.
The measurements obtained here have been compared to existing 
data. The overall agreement is good, while the data provided 
here quadrupled the world bremsstrahlung database above $E_{\gamma}$ = 
2~GeV and covered the previous reported energies with finer 
resolution. This new and greatly expanded set of data provides strong confirmation of the basic features of models based on Regge poles and cuts. There is enough precision to discriminate among the distinct components of those models. Guided by this data, extensions of models and improved parameterization is now possible. From another perspective, the wide angle data agree with the pQCD based constituent counting rules. Yet a significant paradox now appears: the wide angle data disagree - by orders of magnitude - with a handbag model that combines pQCD with the soft region represented by GPDs. This is an important result that needs to be better understood.

% By comparing this new and greatly expanded data set 
%to the predictions of several phenomenological models, the 
%present data were found to support the Regge pole model and the 
%constituent counting rule while disfavoring the Handbag approach.

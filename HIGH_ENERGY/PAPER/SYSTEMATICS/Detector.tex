\subsection{Detector Efficiency Systematic Uncertainty}
 	Each sector in \abbr{CLAS} can be treated as an individual detector, with its own efficiency and resolution. A systematic uncertainty could arise if one or more of the sectors is not simulated properly. It was determined that this systematic uncertainty was incident beam energy dependent.
% 		The procedure to determine the systematic error, $\sigma$, of the sector is to calculate the accepted corrected yield, $\Upsilon^c$, for each sector and compare $\Upsilon^c$ to the average accepted corrected yield of all 6 sectors, $\mu^c$. After $\sigma$ is calculated, it was normalized to $N \mu^c$ as to represent the error as a percentage, which later is multiplied by the measured cross section to determine the appropriate error. 
% 		\begin{align}
% 			\sigma_{sector} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N = 6}\left(\Upsilon_i^c - \mu^c\right)},
% 		\end{align}
% 		where
% 		\begin{align}
% 			\mu^c = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N=6}\Upsilon_i^c
% 		\end{align}
% 		\begin{align}
% 			\sigma_{sector}^{normalized} = \frac{\sigma_{sector}}{N\mu^c}
% 		\end{align}
% 		This calculation was performed for various bins of incoming beam energy to determine the beam energy dependence.% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sys_sec_error}).

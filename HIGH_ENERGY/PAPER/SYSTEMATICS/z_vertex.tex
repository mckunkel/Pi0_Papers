\subsection{$z$-vertex Cut Systematic Uncertainty}
 	The systematic uncertainty of the $z$-vertex cut was analyzed by varying the initial vertex cut from $-110 \le z \le -70$ to $-109 \le z \le -71$ for both data and \abbr{MC}. Afterward the procedure for determining the systematic was identical to the method used to determine the ``Cut Based Systematic Uncertainty". The systematic uncertainty from varying the $z$ was 0.0041.
